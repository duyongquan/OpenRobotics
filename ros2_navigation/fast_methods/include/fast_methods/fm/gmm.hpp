/*! \class GMM
    \brief Templated class which computes Group Marching Method (GMM).
    
    It uses as a main container the nDGridMap class. The nDGridMap type T
    has to be an FMCell or something inherited from it.

    The grid is assumed to be squared, that is Delta(x) = Delta(y) = leafsize_
