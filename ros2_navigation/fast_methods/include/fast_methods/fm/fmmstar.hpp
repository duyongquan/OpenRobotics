/*! \class FMMStar
    \brief Encapsulates the calls to FMM with heuristics enabled.

    It uses as a main container the nDGridMap class. The nDGridMap type T
    has to be an FMCell or something inherited from it.

    The grid is assumed to be squared, that is Delta(x) = Delta(y) = leafsize_

    The type of the heap introduced is very important for the behaviour of the
    algorithm. The following heaps are provided:

    - FMDaryHeap wrap for the Boost D_ary heap (generalization of binary heaps).
    * Set by default if no other heap is specified. The arity has been set to 2
    * (binary heap) since it has been tested to be the more efficient in this algorithm.
    - FMFibHeap wrap for the Boost Fibonacci heap.
    - FMPriorityQueue wrap to the std::PriorityQueue class. This heap implies the implementation
    * of the Simplified FMMStar (SFMMStar) method, done automatically because of the FMPriorityQueue::increase implementation.
